The MacArthur Maze is an intersection of five different freeways: the I880, I980, I580, I80, SR24. It is unique because there are multiple route options to reach destinations of interest. So, if a particular freeway on the Maze is heavily congested or closed, other routes can still be utilized. 

# Question
What effect do freeway closures on the MacArthur Maze affect the Maze? What happens to traffic behavior on the Maze's freeways after the closures?


# Data
Our data was collected from the State of California PeMS website. This data consists of hourly traffic flow (vehicles per hour) for sections of the freeways on and near the Maze for multiple time frames approximately a month long containing the following events: the 2007 I-580 East Connector collapse, the 2009 Emergency Bridge Closure, and the 2013 Labor Day Bridge Closure. Data was collected from previous years of the events to use for comparison. <br />
